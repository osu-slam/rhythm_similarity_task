Welcome to our experiment!\n \nToday, you will be listening to two sound bites and rating how similar they are to one another.\nYou will see two PLAY buttons on screen. Press 'Z' or 'M' to begin the sound bite.\nAfter listening to one, the button will turn green. Play them as many times as you like.\nOnce you have listened to both at least once, rate them by pressing a number between "1" and "7".\n"7" indicates they are identical, and "1" indicates they are not similar at all.\n \nAny questions? If not, press "Right Arrow" to begin!
